The Geometry Viewer is a standalone single page web application that can be user to visualizer and explore VTP files. The only requirement is the single [HTML] file without any web server. This application can be use to load vtp file and use geometry rendering to render them.
The current vtp supported format is __ascii__, __binary__ and __binary+zlib__ compression.
