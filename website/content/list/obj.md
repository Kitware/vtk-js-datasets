title: OBJ Viewer
---

The OBJ Explorer is a standalone single page web application that can be user to visualizer and explore OBJ files. The only requirement is the single [HTML] file without any web server.
That viewer is capable to load a standard OBJ file or a zip containing several OBJ/MTL and image files.
